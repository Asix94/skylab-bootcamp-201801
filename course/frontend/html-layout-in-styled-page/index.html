            shapes and color - every kind of personality that a person could imagine. 
            Everyone seems to have their favorite breed. 
            I guess that is good since it gives many dogs opportunities to have great homes and develop special 
            skills. 
            Many breeds perform very important jobs for people. 
            I personally love the mixed breeds since I have seen literally thousands during my years of helping 
            the shelter. 
            They are all still great dogs inside - some are just a little prettier than others! But every dog, 
            no matter their breeding, is a loyal companion giving unconditional love
